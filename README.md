# Band, Venue, and Concert Management System

This project models a concert management system using SQLAlchemy to represent relationships between **bands**, **venues**, and **concerts**. It allows tracking which bands perform at which venues, and other details such as concert dates, band hometowns, and frequent performance queries.

## Project Structure

This project consists of three main models:

- **Band**: Represents a musical band, including its name and hometown.
- **Venue**: Represents a concert venue, including its title and the city where it's located.
- **Concert**: Represents a concert event where a band performs at a specific venue on a given date.

## Key Features

- **Band Model**:
  - Track venues where a band has performed.
  - Play a concert at a venue.
  - Get a list of all concert introductions for the band.
  - Query the band with the most performances.

- **Venue Model**:
  - Track bands that have performed at the venue.
  - Find the band that has performed the most at this venue.
  - Query concerts that occurred at the venue on a specific date.

- **Concert Model**:
  - Check if a concert is a hometown show for the band.
  - Generate a band introduction based on concert details.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WeddyNKatha165/Concerts.git
   cd Concerts
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have `pipenv` installed, and then install the required dependencies in a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   pipenv install
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   ```

4. **Run the Code**:
   To interact with the code, run:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Virtual Environment and Dependencies

Using `pipenv` ensures that all dependencies are contained within an isolated environment, preventing version conflicts with global packages. This approach makes the environment reproducible, as other developers can use the same `Pipfile.lock` to recreate the same setup.

### Dependencies

The following packages are required:

- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM library for database interaction.
- **pipenv**: For dependency management and virtual environment.

**Note**: You can generate a `requirements.txt` by running the following command:
```bash
pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt
```

## Example Usage

The project includes sample data to demonstrate the relationships and features. You can add bands, venues, and concerts, and perform queries such as:

- Find the band with the most performances.
- Check if a concert is a hometown show.
- List the venues where a band has performed.

## Future Improvements

- Implement additional features such as removing concerts or updating band and venue details.
- Improve data validation and error handling.
